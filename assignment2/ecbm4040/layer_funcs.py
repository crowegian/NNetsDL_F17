def conv2d_forward(x, w, b, pad, stride):
    """
    A Numpy implementation of 2-D image convolution.
    By 'convolution', simple element-wise multiplication and summation will suffice.
    The border mode is 'valid' - Your convolution only happens when your input and your filter fully overlap.
    Another thing to remember is that in TensorFlow, 'padding' means border mode (VALID or SAME). For this practice,
    'pad' means the number rows/columns of zeroes to to concatenate before/after the edge of input.

    Inputs:
    :param x: Input data. Should have size (batch, height, width, channels).
    :param w: Filter. Should have size (num_of_filters, filter_height, filter_width, channels).
    :param b: Bias term. Should have size (num_of_filters, ).
    :param pad: Integer. The number of zeroes to pad along the height and width axis.
    :param stride: Integer. The number of pixels to move between 2 neighboring receptive fields.

    :return: A 4-D array. Should have size (batch, new_height, new_width, num_of_filters).

    Note:
    To calculate the output shape of your convolution, you need the following equations:
    new_height = ((height - filter_height + 2 * pad) // stride) + 1
    new_width = ((width - filter_width + 2 * pad) // stride) + 1

def conv2d_backward(d_top, x, w, b, pad, stride):
    """
    (Optional, but if you solve it correctly, we give you +10 points for this assignment.)
    A lite Numpy implementation of 2-D image convolution back-propagation.

    Inputs:
    :param d_top: The derivatives of pre-activation values from the previous layer
                       with shape (batch, height_new, width_new, num_of_filters).

    :param stride: Integer. The number of pixels to move between 2 neighboring receptive fields.

    :return: (d_w, d_b), i.e. the derivative with respect to w and b. For example, d_w means how a change of each value
     of weight w would affect the final loss function.

    Note:
    Normally we also need to compute d_x in order to pass the gradients down to lower layers, so this is merely a
    simplified version where we don't need to back-propagate.
